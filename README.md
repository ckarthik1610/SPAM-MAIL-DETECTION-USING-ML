# SPAM MAIL DETECTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

The SPAM MAIL DETECTION is a Machine Learning Model based on Logistical Regression. This system invloves differentiating the Mail text into lebels called SPAM and HAM.

**Sample Dataset:**

The system imports the dataset and filters NULL datasets out, then initialises the labels into 0 and 1's (SPAM = 0, HAM = 1).

**TRAIN AND TEST DATA:**
        The system splits the dataset into training and testing datasets. The model we incorporated uses a 80% training and 20% testing dataset.

**FEATURE EXTRACTION**
        This system extracts the words from the mail text and finds words in the mail that act as important features in differentiating SPAM and HAM mail. This method uses a English words repository that omits words like 'of', 'are', 'with' that does not neessarily impact in the distinction. The text in the mail is converted to a numerical value, that later helps in the prediction.

**TRAINING THE MODEL**
        The logistical regression model is trained, using the Feature Extraction data, this model is now capable of making predictions.

**EVALUATING THE MODEL**
        The Model is then cross-verified with the test data labels when tested with the testing data (remaining 20% data).
